[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This modification adds a BBCode to the forum that allows the post author to hide a offtopic in the post, which is clickable to display it to the user.

This BBCode takes the form:
[code][nobbc]
[offtopic]{content}[/offtopic]
[offtopic text=Blah]{content}[/offtopic]
[offtopic quote="Blah"]{content}[/offtopic]
[/nobbc][/code]
Note that quotes are required for the [b]quote[/b] parameter, but not for the [b]text[/b] parameter.  These forms have no issues with other block-level tags inside the offtopic tag.

This BBCode can also take the following form:
[code][nobbc]
[offtopic=Some Text]{content goes here}[/offtopic]
[/nobbc][/code]
Note that, for this form, other block-level bbcode tags are not parsed inside this [b]offtopic[/b] tags form.

[u][b]NEW FOR 2.1:[/b][/u]
Version 2.1 introduces two optional parameters for use:
o [b]hide[/b] parameter indicates the text to replace the default "hide" string
o [b]show[/b] parameter indicates the text to replace the default "show" string.
